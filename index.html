    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <h2>I'm Chris</h2> 
    <p>I'm a Duke University <a href="http://mems.duke.edu/"> Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science</a> major in Durham, North Carolina. 
    You can check out some of my design projects <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtnFyY-FJcmNVPDL29yPDg"> here</a>.
    My college career has involved work in energy and sustainability both  <a href="https://sustainability.duke.edu/campus_groups/ecoreps.html">on campus</a> and the summer of 2015 at <a href="http://nextenergy.org/">NextEnergy</a> as a participant in <a href="http://dukeengage.duke.edu/immersion-programs/us-based-programs/detroit-mi">DukeEngage Detroit</a>. You can check out some of my thoughts on the experience <a href="http://www.dukeengagedetroit.org/student-blog/chris-molthrop-week-7-entry">here</a>.</p><br>
    Last summer, I worked at <a href = "https://www.bmwusfactory.com/">the largest BMW manufacturing plant in the US </a>. I worked on several projects at BMW ranging from data analytics to experimental testing of new equipment. 
    
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy leading <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/new-students/preorientation-programs/project-wild"> hiking trips with Duke students</a>, writing for Duke's sketch comedy group, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DukeIJ">Inside Joke</a>, and doing research into innovative ways we can combat climate change. Regardless of what brought you to this site, feel free to email me at csm42@duke.edu if you have any questions. </p><br>
